# Mergesort

Implement an iterative (no recursive calls) and in-place version of mergesort.
Use the template I've provided in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've
provided some basic testing code that uses
[jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in `code.test.js`.

Hint: To make merge sort in-place, think about what happens during the merge --
where are elements moved to and from? To make it iterative, think about the
part of the array each recursive call considers.

## Runtime Analysis

Analyse the time complexity of your implementation and give a $\Theta$ bound for
its worst-case runtime. Add your answer, including your reasoning, to this
markdown file.

The run-time analysis of the merge sort algorithm, which I believe would be O(n log (n)) for it’s worst case runtime. I believe this because it divides the array into smaller parts and then combines them while comparing and rearranging elements. The number of operations for each step is proportional to the array size with O(n log (n)) time complexity. So the worst case bound is $\Theta$ (n log (n))
